/*  A maths teacher asks her students to give 3 examples for positive odd
 numbers. When the student specifies a correct answer, his/her score is
 incremented by 1. When the student specifies a positive even number, 
his/her score is decremented by 0.5. When the student specifies a negative
 number, he/she will not be given any more chances to correct his or her
 mistake and his/her score will be decremented by 1. So a student's turn 
comes to an end when he/she has correctly specified 3 positive odd numbers 
or when the student has specified a negative number.
  
Few students didn't know the difference between odd numbers and even numbers
 and they made many mistakes and so it was difficult for the teacher to 
maintain the scores. The teacher asks for your help.
  
Can you please help her by writing a  program to calculate the score?
  
Input Format:
Input consists of a list of integers.
  
Output Format:
Output consists of a single line. The score needs to be displayed correct to
 1 decimal place. Refer sample output for details.
  
[For this exercise, don't worry about duplicate odd numbers. Even if the 
students specifies the same odd number thrice, it is accepted].
 
Sample Input 1:
1
3
5
Sample Output 1:
3.0
  
Sample Input 2:
1
2
5
6
7
Sample Output 2:
2.0
  
Sample Input 3:
2
-4
Sample Output 3:
-1.5
  
Sample Input 4:
3
3
3
Sample Output 4:
3.0
