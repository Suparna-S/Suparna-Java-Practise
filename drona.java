/* Drona normally trains his disciples using a board which consists of 
concentric circles. When the student correctly hits the center of the 
concentric circles, his score is 100. The score gets reduced depending on
 where the students hit on the board. When the student hits outside the board,
 his score is 0. Drona will not allow a student to have his food unless he 
scores 100. Arjuna will always hit the target in his first attempt and he
 will leave early.
Others may take more turns to reach the score of 100.
Can you write a program to determine the number of turns a disciple takes
 to reach the target score of 'n' ?
 
Input Format:
Input consists of a list of positive integers. The first integer corresponds
 to the target score 'n'. Assume that all the other integers input are less 
than or equal to n.
 
Output Format:
Output consists of a single line. Refer sample output for format details.
 
Sample Input 1:
100
4
40
60
Sample Output 1:
The number of turns is 3
 
Sample Input 2:
1000
1000
Sample Output 2:
The number of turns is 1
